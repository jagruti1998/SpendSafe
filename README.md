This project focuses on building REST APIs for an online payment wallet application, providing various services to customers. The key features of SpendSafe include robust user validation at every step based on authenticated unique keys for each user, and adherence to a proper architecture-based design, enabling clean and maintainable code.

We've structured the business logic to allow easy access to the current customer at any step, facilitating the implementation of required logic as needed.
